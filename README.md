# Happy Thoughts - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

Practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. Technigo has built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. Think of it as our own version of Twitter, but with less negativity.



Learning Objectives:
- How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
- How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## Approach


## Core Tech
- CSS
- API
- React
- React Hooks
- JSX



## Requirements Completed
🔵  Blue Level
- The page should follow the design as closely as possible
- It should list the most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted)
- The app should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received
- The app should have a form to post new thoughts
- Implement the heart button to send likes on a thought

🔴  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
- Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters
<!-- - When POSTing a new thought, if the message was empty, too long, or too short, you get an error message back from the API. Use this to set some sort of `error` state to show a friendly message to your user. (Hint: Use the network tab of the developer tools in your browser) -->

⚫  Black Level (Advanced Goals)
<!-- - Handle loading states -->
- Keep count of how many different posts you have liked (different from how many times a post has been liked). Keep count and display it in some way. You could even go as far as to store this number in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so that when the page is reloaded, the initial state can be set from the number you've stored.
<!-- - Add an animation for when a new thought is submitted and appears in the list below -->
